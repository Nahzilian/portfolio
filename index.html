                <p>
                    2nd-year Computer Science student at Ryerson University with an interest and enthusiastic attitude towards programming. 
                    After a few years of learning and working on various projects, I have attained specific skill sets and understanding of 
                    web development, data management, data structure and image, video editing. To me, web developing is what I am passionate about, 
                    therefore, my goal is to find a job where I can learn new skills, improve and apply those which I already gained in this field.
